## Overview

**PHPDoc Generator** is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that intelligently generates and updates PHPDoc blocks for your PHP code. It supports advanced features such as PHP parsing, docblock preservation, custom `@settings` integration, MySQL/cached settings, and robust error handling. The extension is designed for real-world PHP projects and is available on the VS Code Marketplace.

## What's New

See the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

**Latest Highlights:**

- **Improved PHP 8 Union Return Type Support**: Extension now correctly handles functions with union return types (`int|string`, `array|bool`, etc.), generating accurate docblocks and properly updating existing ones.
- Automatic synchronization of `@throws` tags in the docblockâ€”new exception types are added when detected in the function, and obsolete tags are removed if the corresponding throw statement is commented out or deleted.
- The default docblock structure is now:

  ```
  @param

  @throws

  @return
  ```

- Parameter and return types are always provided in the docblock, even when not explicitly mentioned in the code (defaults to `mixed` or `void`).
- **Project-wide docblock generation:** Command: `Generate PHPDoc for Entire Project`, Shortcut: `Ctrl+Alt+2`.
- **Exclude patterns:** Provided setting to specify folders and files to skip during project-wide docblock generation. The default exclude list is:
  - `**/node_modules/**`
  - `**/vendor/**`
  - `**/.git/**`
- **New setting: `showStatusBarToggle`** (default: true). Controls whether the status bar toggle for Generate/Update on Save is visible. If set to false, the status bar toggle will be hidden.
- All improvements apply to both single-block, file, and entire-project docblock generation.
