## Overview

**PHPDoc Generator** is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that intelligently generates and updates PHPDoc blocks for your PHP code. It supports advanced features such as PHP parsing, docblock preservation, custom `@settings` integration, MySQL/cached settings, and robust error handling. The extension is designed for real-world PHP projects and is available on the VS Code Marketplace.

## What's New

See the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

**Latest Highlights:**

- Automatic synchronization of `@throws` tags in the docblockâ€”new exception types are added when detected in the function, and obsolete tags are removed if the corresponding throw statement is commented out or deleted.
- The default docblock structure is now:

  ```
  @param

  @throws

  @return
  ```

- Parameter and return types are always provided in the docblock, even when not explicitly mentioned in the code (defaults to `mixed` or `void`).
- **Project-wide docblock generation:** Command: `Generate PHPDoc for Entire Project`, Shortcut: `Ctrl+Alt+2`.
- **Exclude patterns:** The `phpdoc-generator-hiteshgeek.exclude` setting allows you to specify folders and files to skip during project-wide docblock generation. The default exclude list is:
  - `**/node_modules/**`
  - `**/vendor/**`
  - `**/.git/**`
- All improvements apply to both single-block, file, and entire-project docblock generation.

## Features

- **Intelligent PHPDoc Generation**

  - Parses PHP code for accurate block detection.
  - Generates and updates PHPDoc blocks for functions, methods, and classes.
  - Preserves user-written docblock content, including multi-line summaries and descriptions.
  - Robust handling of edge cases and formatting.

- **Custom `@settings` Block Integration** _(for Accrete Globus Technology only)_

  - Detects `getSettings("...")` calls in PHP code.
  - Fetches setting descriptions from a MySQL database or local cache.
  - Only prints the setting key if no description is available, ensuring clean docblocks.
  - **Note:** The `@settings` block is developed and applicable for Accrete Globus Technology (AGT) only.

- **Cache Management** _(for Accrete Globus Technology only)_

  - Automatically creates and populates `settings_cache.json` if missing or empty.
  - Command to manually refresh the settings cache from the database.
  - **Note:** Settings cache management is developed and applicable for Accrete Globus Technology (AGT) only.

- **VS Code Integration**

  - Command palette and keyboard shortcuts for:
    - Generating/updating PHPDoc for the current block (`Ctrl+Alt+0`)
    - Generating/updating PHPDoc for all blocks in the file (`Ctrl+Alt+1`)
    - Generating/updating PHPDoc for the entire project (`Ctrl+Alt+2`)
    - Refreshing the settings cache (`Ctrl+Alt+7`) _(for Accrete Globus Technology only)_
  - Status bar integration for quick access.

- **Error Handling**
  - Docblock generation works even if the DB or cache is unavailable.
  - All file and DB operations are robust and fail gracefully.
